I have been tasked with generating insights into the customer demographics for a UK Bank. They have customers in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. To create better marketing content, they asked me to create some customer segmentation.

---

## Situation

**A UK bank wants to generate a marketing campaign to promote a new financial product they are releasing. The marketing team wants to have customer analytics to determine how to target their marketing campaign.**

---

## Executive Summary

- There are four different geographical customer segments for marketing, with England making up greater than 50% of customers.
- **Customer Personas**
    - **England** - White-Collar Professional in their 30s
    - **Scotland** - Middle-Aged Blue-Collar Male Worker
    - **Northern Ireland** - Non-Traditional Class Women
    - **Wales** - Affluent White-Collar Individuals with Higher Disposable Incomes
    
### Recommendation
Because the customer demographics are very different between the regions, targeted regional marketing campaigns should be implemented rather than simply a general marketing campaign.

## Task
I need to develop a Tableau dashboard to visualize bank customers by geographical region and demographics so that I can convey to stakeholders how to optimize marketing strategies.

---

## Action

1. **Geographical Region:** Show a map of the United Kingdom segmented by the four regions with the number of customers in each region.
2. **Age Distribution:** View the percentage of customers in different age brackets.
3. **Average Bank Balance Distribution:** View the percentage of customers based on their average balance for the past year.
4. **Gender:** View the percentage of customers based on their gender.
5. **Working Class Status:** View the percentage of customers based on their self-selected class of work, such as blue collar, white collar, or other.

## Analysis

#### General Customers
- Age Group is mainly represented by age 30-40
- Gender is split fairly evenly (54:46) male:female
- Almost 50% of customers are white collar
- The distribution of balances is skewed with the largest % of customers with a low balance of 0-15K and it slopes downward continually

<br>
<br>

#### England - White-Collar Professional in their 30s 
- The population is more than 50% of the customers and has the largest influence on the distribution of customers
- There is a large percentage of White Collar workers from England
- There is an almost 50:50 split between male and female
- Age range is predominantly 30-40 years old
- **Takeaway:** Focus on men and women who are white collar in their 30s for marketing

<br>
<br>

#### Scotland - Middle-Aged Blue-Collar Male Worker
- The population is the second largest customer group with almost 25% of the customers
- But has a much different distribution of ages 45-55 years old
- And 72% Male and is 48% blue collar and 44% other
- **Takeaway:** Focus marketing on Blue Collar Men who are middle aged.

<br>
<br>

#### Wales - Affluent White-Collar Individuals with Higher Disposable Incomes 
- Similar to England but with a larger balance that is the primary distribution, 15-30K has a largest distribution
- **Takeaway:** Focus marketing on White Collar men and women who may have more money than other regions

<br>
<br>

#### Northern Ireland - Non-Traditional Class Women
- 74% of customers are female
- 50% of customers are "Other" for their employment class
- **Takeaway:** Focus marketing on women who are labeled "Other" class

## Summary

The customer analysis reveals a nuanced demographic landscape across different regions. In England, white-collar professionals in their 30s emerge as the dominant customer group, with a balanced gender distribution. Scotland presents a distinct profile, with middle-aged, male, blue-collar workers comprising the majority. Wales showcases a concentration of affluent white-collar individuals, particularly those with higher disposable incomes. Conversely, Northern Ireland stands out with a significant presence of non-traditional class women. These insights underscore the importance of tailored marketing strategies to effectively engage with diverse customer segments, maximizing outreach and resonance in each region.
