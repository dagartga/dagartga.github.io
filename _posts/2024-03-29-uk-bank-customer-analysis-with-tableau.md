I have been tasked with generating insights into the customer demographics for a UK Bank. They have customers in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. To create better marketing content, they asked me to create some customer segmentation.

### Situation:

**The bank wants to generate a marketing campaign to promote a new financial product they are releasing. The marketing team wants to have customer analytics to create targeted marketing campaigns based on different regions.**

---

### Task:
I need to develop a Tableau dashboard to visualize bank customers by geographical region and demographics so that I can convey to stakeholders how to optimize marketing strategies.

---
### Action:

1. **Geographical Region:** Show a map of the United Kingdom segmented by the four regions with the number of customers in each region.
2. **Age Distribution:** View the percentage of customers in different age brackets.
3. **Average Bank Balance Distribution:** View the percentage of customers based on their average balance for the past year.
4. **Gender:** View the percentage of customers based on their gender.
5. **Working Class Status:** View the percentage of customers based on their self-selected class of work, such as blue collar, white collar, or other.

### Analysis:

#### General Customers
- Age Group is mainly represented by age 30-40
- Gender is split fairly evenly (54:46) male:female
- Almost 50% of customers are white collar
- The distribution of balances is skewed with the largest % of customers with a low balance of 0-15K and it slopes downward continually

#### England
- The population is more than 50% of the customers and has the largest influence on the distribution of customers
- There is a large percentage of White Collar workers from England
- There is an almost 50:50 split between male and female
- Age range is predominantly 30-40 years old
- **Takeaway:** Focus on men and women who are white collar in their 30s for marketing

#### Scotland
- The population is the second largest customer group with almost 25% of the customers
- But has a much different distribution of ages 45-55 years old
- And 72% Male and is 48% blue collar and 44% other
- **Takeaway:** Focus marketing on Blue Collar Men who are middle aged.

#### Wales
- Similar to England but with a larger balance that is the primary distribution, 15-30K has a largest distribution
- **Takeaway:** Focus marketing on White Collar men and women who may have more money than other regions

#### Northern Ireland
- 74% of customers are female
- 50% of customers are Other for their employment class
- **Takeaway:** Focus marketing on women who are not traditional working class
